**Description**: a color game made for Apple Watch.[ Source Code][1]

**Features**:

  * Easy to play color game, just choose the right matching colors and you&#8217;ll get a score increase
  * Use force touch to trigger the menu to stop game, check scores or set the playing time

**Notes**:

  * It&#8217;s a known problem that the watch app runs quite slowly. I tried to incorporate framework, but it just slows down the app a lot. And sometimes, it stops at the loading screen.
  * I also tried to pay a &#8220;Show Score&#8221; button at the first screen, ironically half the time the app will stop at the loading screen. So I moved it to settings
  * I realized that I had some spelling problem with the app, too much waiting for the loading screen to change, so I just let it go.

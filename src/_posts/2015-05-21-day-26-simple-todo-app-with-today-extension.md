**Description**: a simple todo app with today extension and Apple Watch extension. [Source Code][1]

**Features**:

  * The App, today extension and Apple Watch extension share the same code from custom Framework
  * Share the same data across the app and extensions
  * Open the detail todo item directly from today extension

**Known issue**:

Somehow it seems the Apple Watch app does not co-exist with the today extension app. It does not run until I delete the today extension. Took me long time to realize&#8230;

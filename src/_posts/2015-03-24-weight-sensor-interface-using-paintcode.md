  <strong>Notes and Takeaways:</strong>
</div>

  * I was totally amazed by the flexibility of drawing with PaintCode. It saves so much time.
  * Even better, combined with Xcode’s LiveView ability, you can design and layout the view without firing up the simulator.
  * The code generated by PaintCode doesn’t really do the range checking by itself, which is a bit misleading since you’d think that that a “Fraction” in design phase would stay as a “Fraction” in Swift code as well.
  * Great tool. I’ll definitely continue to use it. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-728" src="/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paintcode-screenshot.png" alt="paintcode-screenshot" width="1387" height="953" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-731" src="/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/xcodescreenshot.png" alt="xcodescreenshot" width="1390" height="741" />

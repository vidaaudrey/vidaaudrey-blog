Spanish, using as a native language by approximately 406 million people in the world, is the second only to Mandarin in terms of its number of native speakers worldwide.  It’s a passionate language and is fun to learn. Below are some top resources that I found:

<p><strong><a title="http://www.michelthomas.com/learn-spanish.php" href="http://www.michelthomas.com/learn-spanish.php" target="_blank">Michel Thomas Learn Spanish</a></strong>: my #1 course to start whenever I try to learn a new language. There are basic, advanced, vocabulary and language builder courses available.</p>

Love it.</p>
